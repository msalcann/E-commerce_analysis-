ECommerceData-DSA210Project

Project Overview

Over the next few months, I will examine how various e-commerce factors influence order volumes and customer satisfaction. By analyzing data on daily orders, discount rates, product categories, shipping durations, weather conditions, and customer demographics, I aim to uncover which elements drive higher sales and improved satisfaction. Through data visualization and statistical methods, I’ll test whether strategic adjustments—like changing discount strategies or optimizing order preparation times—lead to measurable gains in overall platform performance.
 
Objectives
1.	Identify Key Drivers of Order Volume
Determine which variables (e.g., discount rates, product categories, weather conditions) most strongly correlate with increased daily or weekly order counts.
2.	Understand Customer Satisfaction
Explore how factors like total order preparation time, returns, demographics, and discounts influence overall customer satisfaction (or dissatisfaction, via return behavior).
3.	Data-Driven Strategy
Use insights to recommend tactical improvements, such as refining logistics timelines or focusing on specific campaigns to maintain high satisfaction and sales.
4.	Strengthen Data Science Skills
Apply DSA 210 course concepts—data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, and modeling—in a realistic e-commerce setting.
 
Motivation

Boosting Sales:
Every e-commerce business aims to increase order volume. By identifying the levers (e.g., category-based promos, timely deliveries) that drive more purchases, resources can be allocated more effectively.

Enhancing the Customer Experience:
Satisfied customers are more likely to repurchase and recommend the service to others. Understanding factors that cause dissatisfaction or returns helps shape better user experiences.

Operational Excellence:
Data-driven insights support inventory planning, marketing calendars, and staffing to align with demand fluctuations, improving overall efficiency.

Practical Learning:
This project provides a hands-on opportunity to move beyond theoretical knowledge, reinforcing analytics skills that can be applied broadly.
 
Dataset

My dataset spans a chosen period (several months in 2022) and includes:


1.	Order Details

o	Order ID: Unique identifier

o	Date: The date the order was placed

o	Product Name / ID / Category: Product information

o	Brand: Brand identification (if applicable)

o	Quantity: Number of units purchased

o	Discount Rate: Applied discount percentage


2.	Customer Data

o	Customer ID: Unique identifier for each buyer

o	Age / Gender: Demographic info (if available)

o	City / Region: Where the customer is located

o	is_new_customer: New vs. returning customer indicator


3.	Order Fulfillment

o	Preparation Time: Time from order placement to shipping (days)

o	Delivery Date: If available, to calculate total fulfillment time (order → delivery)

o	Return Status: Whether the item was returned (0 or 1)

4.	Weather / Seasonal Factors (if applicable)

o	Daily Weather Conditions: Temperature, precipitation, or a simple “rainy vs. non-rainy” flag

o	Holiday / Special Campaign: Indicators for major sales events (e.g., Black Friday)

 
Tools and Technologies

•	Python & Pandas: Data ingestion, cleaning, and merging

•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizing trends and relationships (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)

•	SciPy / Statsmodels: Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, etc.)

•	Scikit-Learn: For optional modeling tasks (classification or regression)

•	Jupyter Notebook: Documenting and presenting findings interactively

 
Analysis Plan

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

•	Import & Consolidate: Load the e-commerce dataset (CSV/Excel) into a DataFrame.

•	Clean Data: Handle missing values, standardize product categories, ensure date columns are consistent.

•	Feature Engineering:

o	Create daily_order_count by grouping orders by date.

o	Compute total fulfillment time if both shipping and delivery dates exist.

o	Merge weather or holiday info by date.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•	Correlation Heatmap: Identify relationships among discount rate, daily order volume, returns, fulfillment time, and weather.

•	Time Series Plots: Observe daily/weekly order counts and any patterns tied to seasons or events.

•	Bar Charts / Box Plots:

o	Distribution of product categories vs. average order count or returns.

o	Variation in fulfillment time by month or region.

 
Hypothesis Testing

1.	Discount Rate’s Effect on Order Volume

o	H₀: Daily order volume is not significantly different on days with high discounts vs. normal discounts.

o	Hₐ: Days with higher discounts see a significant increase in order volume.

o	Approach: Independent t-test comparing two sets of daily order counts.

2.	Weather Influence on Order Volume

o	H₀: Weather conditions (e.g., rainy vs. clear) do not affect daily order volume.

o	Hₐ: Rainy days have a different (potentially higher) order volume compared to clear days.

o	Approach: Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U, depending on data distribution.

3.	Total Preparation/Fulfillment Time vs. Customer Satisfaction

o	H₀: Longer order preparation (or total fulfillment) times do not impact return rates or satisfaction.

o	Hₐ: Increased preparation/fulfillment times correlate with higher return rates or lower satisfaction.

o	Approach: Could use correlation analysis (Spearman’s if skewed) or logistic regression (returns as 0/1 outcome).

4.	New vs. Returning Customers

o	H₀: New and returning customers show no significant difference in average order value or likelihood of returning products.

o	Hₐ: New customers differ significantly (e.g., higher or lower returns) compared to returning customers.

o	Approach: t-test or chi-square test (if comparing return proportions).
 
Conclusion

By the end of this project, I aim to answer:

1.	Which factors most strongly drive order volume?
o	Do discounts or external variables (like weather) have a larger impact?

2.	How do fulfillment times influence customer satisfaction or return behavior?
o	Does reducing preparation time significantly lower the return rate?

3.	Are there notable differences between new vs. returning customers?
o	Should strategies differ to better retain first-time buyers?

Using data science techniques—cleaning, EDA, hypothesis testing, potential modeling—this project will yield actionable insights to optimize e-commerce operations. The findings can guide resource allocation, promotional strategies, and logistical improvements to boost both order volumes and customer satisfaction.
